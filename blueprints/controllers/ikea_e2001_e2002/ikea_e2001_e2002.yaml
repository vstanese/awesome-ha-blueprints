blueprint:
  name: Controller - IKEA E2001/E2002 STYRBAR remote control N2
  description: |
    Controller automation for executing any kind of action triggered by an IKEA E2001/E2002 STYRBAR remote control N2. Allows to optionally loop an action on a button long press.
    Supports deCONZ, ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT.

    Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
    Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more.

    Full documentation for this controller and list of available Hooks [here](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e2001_e2002).
